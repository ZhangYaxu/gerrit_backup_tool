# TODO

- Upload file 'repo_list_filename' to S3 and use it during restore if command line argument '--repo-list' is not defined.
- Add Debug argument
- Create scheduled task / Jenkins Job
- Maybe, add support of overriding config options with command line arguments
- Re-add functions to stop and start instances
- Re-add functions for volume snapshot
- Convert config to YMAL format for readability
- Look at keyring <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring> for storing sensitive data
- Maybe find / use a good task manager / scheduler
